I am Gidon Frischkorn, a cognitive psychologist currently working in the cognitive psychology lab under the direction of Prof. Klaus Oberauer at the University of Zurich (UZH). From 2009 until 2015, I studied psychology at Heidelberg University where I also finished my PhD on Basic cognitive processes of intelligence in early 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Dirk Hagemann.
